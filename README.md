# Building a Simple Machine Learning Model Development Pipeline with Apache Airflow

**Introduction**
When it comes to machine learning (ML) models development, it’s not just about training the model. You need to handle data collection, feature engineering, model evaluation, and serving. Additionally, your ML system must meet production software requirements such as scalability, consistency, modularity, testability, and security. Enter the ML pipeline—a systematic way to automate the end-to-end ML process.


**Objective** 
In this project, we’ll create an ML pipeline using Apache Airflow. Our pipeline will cover the entire ML workflow, from data preparation to model deployment.


**Why Apache Airflow?**
1. Extensive Features: Airflow provides an extensive set of features for workflow management.
2. Beautiful UI: Its built-in user interface makes monitoring and managing workflows straightforward.
3. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs): Airflow allows you to programmatically author and schedule workflows using DAGs.
